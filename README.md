<h4>Why <em>NODEjs</em>?</h4>

<h3>Frontend</h3>

<h4>What is <em>IONIC</em>?</h4>
Website : https://ionicframework.com/
<p>
 Ionic Framework is an open source UI toolkit for building performant, high-quality mobile and desktop apps using web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).

<kbd>Ionic Framework is focused on the frontend user experience, or UI interaction of an app (controls, interactions, gestures, animations)</kbd>. Itâ€™s easy to learn, and integrates nicely with other libraries or frameworks, such as Angular, or can be used standalone without a frontend framework using a simple script include.

Currently, Ionic Framework has official integrations with Angular and React, and support for Vue is in development.
</p>


<h4>Why <em>IONIC</em>?</h4>

<p>
Thanks to IONIC we can build a mobile website by packaging it into a Cordova app.  

Current supported platforms: <kbd>iOS 8.0+, Android 4.4+, UWP apps</kbd>

Ionic's goal is to facilitate this process in several ways:

Using the latest development tools.

Provide a graphical framework (for the layout but also the navigation in the app).

Facilitate integration with Cordova and its plugins.

Offer a set of "pro" (but not free) tools.
